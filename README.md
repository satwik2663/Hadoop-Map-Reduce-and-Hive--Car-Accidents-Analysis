# Big-Data-with-Hadoop-Map-Reduce-and-Hive-Car-Accidents-Analysis

This is a countrywide auto collision dataset, which covers 49 states of the USA. The mishap information is gathered from February 2016 to June 2020, utilizing two APIs that give streaming traffic occurrence (or occasion) information. These APIs broadcast traffic information caught by an assortment of substances, for example, the US and state divisions of transportation, law implementation offices, traffic cameras, and traffic sensors inside the street organizations. Right now, there are about 3.5 million mishap records in this dataset. In this project, we are focused on performing Map Reduce with Java in a single standalone cluster on virtual machine

# Performed Map Reduce with Java to analyze:
<b> Total Number of accidents on Left and Right side </b> <br>
<b> Weekday Analysis  Total Number of accidents </b><br>
<b> Monthly Analysis  Total Number of accidents </b><br>
<b> State Analysis  Total Number of accidents – top 10 prone</b><br>
<b> Hourly Analysis  Total Number of accidents</b><br>
<b> Temperature Analysis </b><br>
<b> Year and State Analysis  Total Number of accidents </b><br>
